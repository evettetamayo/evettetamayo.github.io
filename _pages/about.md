Welcome! My name is Evette Tamayo. I am a photographer based in Chicago, IL. I specialize in sports photography with a passion for capturing the story of athletes. I'm an Illinois native who loves sports: from playing to creating content. I'm a former athlete that turned their passion for sports into photography and videography. After graduating high school, I furthered my education at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Working with the department of athletics, I served as a student manager for the women's soccer team. There I crafted social media content as their photographer and videographer. Not only a photographer for UIC womenâ€™s soccer but also shooting a variety of sports from basketball to softball at UIC. I also previously interned with the Chicago Sky, creating content for the WNBA.
